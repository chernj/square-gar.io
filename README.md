# square-gar.io
A WIP prototype of a game written in vanilla Javascript inspired by agar.io

Just like agar.io this game focuses on the player consuming others to grow, however this game's movement is grid-based. This provides a contrast from agar.io, where instead of being a circular blob players have distinct shapes that affect movement and gameplay over time.

-- TODO: 
  - implement infinite grid
  - implement simple AI
  - implement eating other entities
